# Desa Digital Public Service Dashboard

## Description
Desa Digital Public Service Dashboard is a unified platform for integrated public services in rural areas (Desa Digital). It provides a centralized dashboard for various government services, including administrative requests (e.g., letter submissions, permits), public information access, and community services. Front-end is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface. Back-end uses Golang with Gin framework to handle server-side logic, API endpoints, and static file serving, making it ready to deploy on any server.
